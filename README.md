# *Stock Price Prediction Project*:
Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties(This project is inspired from one of my previous project:https://github.com/subhamChakraborty23/NSE_Stock_Analysis_and_price_prediction_usin_XGboost). We will develop this project into two parts:

- First, we will predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
- Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.
## Datasets:
- To build the stock price prediction model, we will use the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset. This is a dataset of Tata Beverages from Tata Global Beverages Limited, National       Stock Exchange of India: Tata Global Dataset
- To develop the dashboard for stock analysis we will use another stock dataset with multiple stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook: Stocks Dataset.
## Dependencies:
- Keras
- Plotly
- Tensorflow
- Scikit learn
- Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib
- Dash(for dashboard creation)
